[Verse 1]
Darling, happy birthday
In the sky, in the sky
You were blown away
I don’t know why, why
Now I sit and wait
As days float by, bye
Darling, happy birthday
In the sky, in the sky

[Chorus]
I want my medicine
(Give me my medicine)
I want my medicine
(Give me my medicine)
I want my medicine
(Give me my medicine)

[Verse 2]
Darling, happy birthday
In the sky, in the sky
Now I fade and fade
As time runs dry, dry

[Chorus]
I want my medicine
(Give me my medicine)
I want my medicine
(Give me my medicine)
I want my mеdicine
(Give me my mеdicine)
I want my medicine
I want my medicine
(Give me my medicine)
I want my medicine
(Give me my medicine)
I want my medicine
(Give me my medicine, give me my medicine)
